<h3>Food Lion: Holding</h3>
<p>By secretly recording business operations to expose unsanitary and

<h3>Duty of Loyalty</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>[A]lthough our state courts recognize the existence of an employee’s
duty of loyalty, we do not recognize its breach as an independent claim.
Evidence of such a breach serves only as a justification for a
defendant-employer in a wrongful termination action by an employee</p>

<h2>Pre-Emption of PPA Suits</h2>
<p>NLRA pre-emption will apply to a PPA suit based on protected

whether activity is protected, state courts may not decide that question
in a PPA suit.</p>
