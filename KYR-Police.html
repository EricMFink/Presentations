<h1>Police Encounters &amp; Arrests</h1>

</section>
<section id="police-questioning" class="title-slide slide level2">
<h2>Police Questioning</h2>
<p>In general, a police officer may lawfully ask you questions at any
time, without having to demonstrate reasonable suspicion or probable
cause.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you speak to a law enforcement officer, your statements may be
used against you and others.</li>
<li>It is a criminal offense to provide false information to a police
officer.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="constitutional-rights-when-questioned-by-police"
class="title-slide slide level3">
<h3>Constitutional Rights When Questioned by Police</h3>
<p>You have a right to refuse to answer police questions, and the right
to consult with a lawyer before agreeing to speak to the police. These
rights apply whether or not you have been detained or arrested.</p>
</section>
<section id="miranda-warning" class="slide level4">
<h4>Miranda Warning</h4>
<p>The police are not required to inform you of those rights unless they
intend to conduct a custodial interrogation (i.e. question you while
under arrest or otherwise not free to go).</p>
</section>
<section id="right-to-remain-silent" class="slide level4">
<h4>Right to Remain Silent</h4>
<p>You are not required to tell the police that you are exercising your
right to remain silent.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is usually a good idea to do so.</li>
<li>Even if you answer some questions, you may still stop and refuse to
answer any further questions until you have a lawyer.</li>
<li>You may not lawfully be arrested or punished for failing or refusing
to answer police questions.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="right-to-counsel" class="slide level4">
<h4>Right to Counsel</h4>
<p>Police officers may try to pressure or persuade you to speak to them
without a consulting a lawyer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bear in mind that the police are legally permitted to lie to
you.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="common-police-tactics" class="slide level4">
<h4>Common Police Tactics</h4>
<p>Police officers may say that you are better off without a lawyer.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is almost never true.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="common-police-tactics-1" class="slide level4">
<h4>Common Police Tactics</h4>
<p>Police officers may threaten you with a grand jury subpoena.</p>
<ul>
<li>They may be bluffing</li>
<li>Even if they’re not, you are entitled to consult with a lawyer
before testifying.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="common-police-tactics-2" class="slide level4">
<h4>Common Police Tactics</h4>
<p>Police officers may promise leniency in criminal charges or
sentencing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Criminal charges and plea bargains are up to the prosecutor, not the
police.</li>
</ul>
</section>


<section id="police-stops--detention" class="title-slide slide level2">
<h2>Police Stops &amp; Detention</h2>
<p>If you are stopped by a police officer, you are legally entitled to
walk away unless you have been detained or arrested. If you’re unsure,
you can ask if you are free to go.</p>
</section>
<section id="police-stops" class="title-slide slide level3">
<h3>Police Stops</h3>
<p>It is generally a good idea to walk away calmly.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you run, or otherwise act in a “furtive” “suspicious” manner, the
officer might use that as a pretext to detain or arrest you.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="police-stops-1" class="title-slide slide level3">
<h3>Police Stops</h3>
<p>It is generally not a good idea to argue with or insult the
officer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Even though your statements may be protected under the 1st
Amendment, the officer is unlikely to be persuaded and is likely to
react by detaining or arresting you.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="detention" class="title-slide slide level3">
<h3>Detention</h3>
<p>Detention means that you have been stopped by a police officer and
are not free to go.</p>
<ul>
<li>Detention may lead to an arrest, but it is not the same thing.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="detention-constitutional-rights" class="slide level4">
<h4>Detention: Constitutional Rights</h4>
<p>If you are detained, your constitutional rights (including the right
to remain silent) apply, but the police are not required to inform you
of those rights unless you are arrested.</p>
</section>

<section id="pat-downs" class="title-slide slide level3">
<h3>Pat-Downs</h3>
<p>If you are detained, the officer may conduct a “pat down” (an
external check) for weapons.</p>
</section>
<section id="reasonable-suspicion" class="slide level4">
<h4>Reasonable Suspicion</h4>
<p>Legally, a police officer is required to have “reasonable suspicion”
that you are armed and dangerous before conducting a pat down.</p>
<ul>
<li>Police often cite “furtive” or “suspicious” movements or demeanor to
justify a pat down.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="searches" class="title-slide slide level3">
<h3>Searches</h3>
<p>If you are detained but not arrested, the officer may not lawfully
conduct any search beyond a pat-down (e.g. inside your pockets, under
your clothing, inside a bag or other item) without your consent or
“probable cause”.</p>
</section>
<section id="consent-to-search" class="slide level4">
<h4>Consent to Search</h4>
<p>You may tell a police officer you do not consent to a search.</p>
<ul>
<li>Refusal to consent is not probable cause for a search.</li>
<li>If the officer proceeds (which is likely), you do not have a legal
right to physically resist.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="probable-cause" class="slide level4">
<h4>Probable Cause</h4>
<p>Probable cause means that the officer has knowledge of facts
sufficient to support a reasonable belief that you are engaged in
criminal activity or have evidence of a crime in your possession.</p>
</section>


<section id="arrests" class="title-slide slide level2">
<h2>Arrests</h2>
<p>Arrests, like searches, require probable cause.</p>
</section>
<section id="notice-of-arrest" class="title-slide slide level3">
<h3>Notice of Arrest</h3>
<p>Police officers will usually tell you if you are being placed under
arrest.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are unsure, you may ask.</li>
<li>The officer will not necessarily inform you of the charges at the
time of arrest.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="resisting-arrest" class="slide level4">
<h4>Resisting Arrest</h4>
<p>Resisting arrest is a crime, even if the arrest itself is unlawful or
the police use excessive force in carrying out the arrest.</p>
</section>
<section id="search-incident-to-arrest" class="slide level4">
<h4>Search Incident to Arrest</h4>
<p>Once you have been placed under arrest, the police may lawfully
conduct a search:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inside your clothing and any objects you are holding or
carrying.</li>
<li>The area within your immediate control.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="miranda-warning-1" class="slide level4">
<h4>Miranda Warning</h4>
<p>If you are arrested, the police may not lawfully interrogate you
without advising you of your right to refuse to answer questions and
your right to legal representation.</p>
<p>The police may recite the <em>Miranda</em> warning at the time of
arrest or at a later time prior to any interrogation.</p>
</section>


<section id="rights-following-arrest" class="title-slide slide level2">
<h2>Rights Following Arrest</h2>

</section>
<section id="phone-call" class="title-slide slide level3">
<h3>Phone Call</h3>
<p>You have the right to make a phone call within a reasonable time
after being arrested.</p>
</section>
<section id="surveillance-of-phone-calls" class="slide level4">
<h4>Surveillance of Phone Calls</h4>
<p>The police may not listen to your calls with your lawyer.</p>
<p>But they may (and mostly likely will) listen to any other calls.</p>
</section>

<section id="court-appearance" class="title-slide slide level3">
<h3>Court Appearance</h3>
<p>You have the right to appear before a judge or magistrate within a
reasonable time after being arrested (usually within 48 hours).</p>
</section>
<section id="arraignment" class="slide level4">
<h4>Arraignment</h4>
<p>The purpose of this appearance is to hear the formal charges against
you, decide on bail, and enter a plea.</p>
</section>
<section id="legal-representation" class="slide level4">
<h4>Legal Representation</h4>
<p>You have a right to be represented by a lawyer at an arraignment and
all other court appearances.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you can’t afford a lawyer, you have a right to be represented at
no cost by a public defender or other court-appointed lawyer.</li>
</ul>
