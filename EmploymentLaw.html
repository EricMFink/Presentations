<h2>Employment as Private Government</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine a government that assigns almost everyone a superior whom
they must obey. Although superiors give most inferiors a routine to
follow, there is no rule of law. Orders may be arbitrary and can change
at any time, without prior notice or opportunity to appeal. Superiors
are unaccountable to those they order around. They are neither elected
nor removable by their inferiors. Inferiors have no right to complain in
court about how they are being treated, except in a few narrowly defined
cases. They also have no right to be consulted about the orders they are
given.</p>

<h2>The Scope of Employer Control</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This government does not recognize a personal or private sphere of
autonomy free from sanction. It may prescribe a dress code and forbid
certain hairstyles. Everyone lives under surveillance, to ensure that
they are complying with orders. Superiors may snoop into inferiors’
e-mail and record their phone conversations. Suspicionless searches of
their bodies and personal effects may be routine. They can be ordered to
submit to medical testing. The government may dictate the language
spoken and forbid communication in any other language. It may forbid
certain topics of discussion. People can be sanctioned for their
consensual sexual activity or for their choice of spouse or life
partner. They can be sanctioned for their political activity and
required to engage in political activity they do not agree with.</p>

<h3>Good Faith &amp; Fair Dealing</h3>

<p>In determining whether there exists an implied-in-fact promise for
some form of continued employment courts have considered a variety of
factors in addition to the existence of independent consideration. These
have included, for example, the personnel policies or practices of the
employer, the employee’s longevity of service, actions or communications
by the employer reflecting assurances of continued employment, and the
practices of the industry in which the employee is engaged.</p>

<p>Under the rationale of Sides, Coman, and Amos, something more than a
mere statutory violation is required to sustain a claim of wrongful
discharge under the public-policy exception. An employer wrongfully
discharges an at-will employee if the termination is done for “an
unlawful reason or purpose that contravenes public policy.”</p>
<p>[ *** ]</p>
<p>In this case, defendant’s allegedly unlawful conduct was the failure
to comply with a regulatory statute governing employee drug-testing
procedures. In contrast, defendant’s reason for terminating plaintiff’s
employment was permissible. Under the doctrine of employment at will, an
employer who may fire an employee for any reason or no reason at all may
certainly terminate an employee for suspected drug use as part of an
effort to maintain a drug-free workplace.</p>
