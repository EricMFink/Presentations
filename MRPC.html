<h2>Rule 1.1: Competence</h2>
<p>A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client.
Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill,
thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the
representation.</p>
</section>

<section
id="rule-12-scope-of-representation--allocation-of-authority-between-client--lawyer"
class="title-slide slide level2">
<h2>Rule 1.2: Scope of Representation &amp; Allocation of Authority
Between Client &amp; Lawyer</h2>
<p>(a) Subject to paragraphs (c) and (d), a lawyer shall abide by a
client’s decisions concerning the objectives of representation and, as
required by Rule 1.4, shall consult with the client as to the means by
which they are to be pursued. A lawyer may take such action on behalf of
the client as is impliedly authorized to carry out the representation. A
lawyer shall abide by a client’s decision whether to settle a matter. In
a criminal case, the lawyer shall abide by the client’s decision, after
consultation with the lawyer, as to a plea to be entered, whether to
waive jury trial and whether the client will testify.</p>
<p>(b) A lawyer’s representation of a client, including representation
by appointment, does not constitute an endorsement of the client’s
political, economic, social or moral views or activities.</p>
<p>(c) A lawyer may limit the scope of the representation if the
limitation is reasonable under the circumstances and the client gives
informed consent.</p>
<p>(d) A lawyer shall not counsel a client to engage, or assist a
client, in conduct that the lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent, but
a lawyer may discuss the legal consequences of any proposed course of
conduct with a client and may counsel or assist a client to make a good
faith effort to determine the validity, scope, meaning or application of
the law.</p>
</section>

<section id="rule-13-diligence" class="title-slide slide level2">
<h2>Rule 1.3: Diligence</h2>
<p>A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in
representing a client.</p>
</section>

<section id="rule-14-communications" class="title-slide slide level2">
<h2>Rule 1.4: Communications</h2>
<p>(a) A lawyer shall:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) promptly inform the client of any decision or circumstance with
respect to which the client’s informed consent, as defined in Rule
1.0(e), is required by these Rules;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) reasonably consult with the client about the means by which the
client’s objectives are to be accomplished;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(3) keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the
matter;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(4) promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(5) consult with the client about any relevant limitation on the
lawyer’s conduct when the lawyer knows that the client expects
assistance not permitted by the Rules of Professional Conduct or other
law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(b) A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably
necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the
representation.</p>
</section>

<section id="rule-15-fees" class="title-slide slide level2">
<h2>Rule 1.5: Fees</h2>
<p>(a) A lawyer shall not make an agreement for, charge, or collect an
unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses. The factors to
be considered in determining the reasonableness of a fee include the
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the
questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service
properly;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) the likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of
the particular employment will preclude other employment by the
lawyer;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal
services;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(4) the amount involved and the results obtained;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the
circumstances;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the
client;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers
performing the services; and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(b) The scope of the representation and the basis or rate of the fee
and expenses for which the client will be responsible shall be
communicated to the client, preferably in writing, before or within a
reasonable time after commencing the representation, except when the
lawyer will charge a regularly represented client on the same basis or
rate. Any changes in the basis or rate of the fee or expenses shall also
be communicated to the client.</p>
<p>(c) A fee may be contingent on the outcome of the matter for which
the service is rendered, except in a matter in which a contingent fee is
prohibited by paragraph (d) or other law. A contingent fee agreement
shall be in a writing signed by the client and shall state the method by
which the fee is to be determined, including the percentage or
percentages that shall accrue to the lawyer in the event of settlement,
trial or appeal; litigation and other expenses to be deducted from the
recovery; and whether such expenses are to be deducted before or after
the contingent fee is calculated. The agreement must clearly notify the
client of any expenses for which the client will be liable whether or
not the client is the prevailing party. Upon conclusion of a contingent
fee matter, the lawyer shall provide the client with a written statement
stating the outcome of the matter and, if there is a recovery, showing
the remittance to the client and the method of its determination.</p>
<p>(d) A lawyer shall not enter into an arrangement for, charge, or
collect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) any fee in a domestic relations matter, the payment or amount of
which is contingent upon the securing of a divorce or upon the amount of
alimony or support, or property settlement in lieu thereof; or</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) a contingent fee for representing a defendant in a criminal
case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(e) A division of a fee between lawyers who are not in the same firm
may be made only if:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) the division is in proportion to the services performed by each
lawyer or each lawyer assumes joint responsibility for the
representation;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) the client agrees to the arrangement, including the share each
lawyer will receive, and the agreement is confirmed in writing; and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(3) the total fee is reasonable.</p>
</blockquote>
</section>

<section id="rule-16-confidentiality-of-information"
class="title-slide slide level2">
<h2>Rule 1.6: Confidentiality of Information</h2>
<p>(a) A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to the
representation of a client unless the client gives informed consent, the
disclosure is impliedly authorized in order to carry out the
representation or the disclosure is permitted by paragraph (b).</p>
<p>(b) A lawyer may reveal information relating to the representation of
a client to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily
harm;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) to prevent the client from committing a crime or fraud that is
reasonably certain to result in substantial injury to the financial
interests or property of another and in furtherance of which the client
has used or is using the lawyer’s services;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(3) to prevent, mitigate or rectify substantial injury to the
financial interests or property of another that is reasonably certain to
result or has resulted from the client’s commission of a crime or fraud
in furtherance of which the client has used the lawyer’s services;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(4) to secure legal advice about the lawyer’s compliance with these
Rules;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(5) to establish a claim or defense on behalf of the lawyer in a
controversy between the lawyer and the client, to establish a defense to
a criminal charge or civil claim against the lawyer based upon conduct
in which the client was involved, or to respond to allegations in any
proceeding concerning the lawyer’s representation of the client</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(6) to comply with other law or a court order; or</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(7) to detect and resolve conflicts of interest arising from the
lawyer’s change of employment or from changes in the composition or
ownership of a firm, but only if the revealed information would not
compromise the attorney-client privilege or otherwise prejudice the
client.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(c) A lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to prevent the inadvertent
or unauthorized disclosure of, or unauthorized access to, information
relating to the representation of a client.</p>
</section>

<section id="rule-17-conflict-of-interest-current-clients"
class="title-slide slide level2">
<h2>Rule 1.7: Conflict of Interest: Current Clients</h2>
<p>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), a lawyer shall not represent
a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of
interest. A concurrent conflict of interest exists if:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) the representation of one client will be directly adverse to
another client; or</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) there is a significant risk that the representation of one or
more clients will be materially limited by the lawyer’s responsibilities
to another client, a former client or a third person or by a personal
interest of the lawyer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(b) Notwithstanding the existence of a concurrent conflict of
interest under paragraph (a), a lawyer may represent a client if:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) the lawyer reasonably believes that the lawyer will be able to
provide competent and diligent representation to each affected
client;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) the representation is not prohibited by law;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(3) the representation does not involve the assertion of a claim by
one client against another client represented by the lawyer in the same
litigation or other proceeding before a tribunal; and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(4) each affected client gives informed consent, confirmed in
writing.</p>
</blockquote>
</section>

<section id="rule-18-current-clients-specific-rules"
class="title-slide slide level2">
<h2>Rule 1.8: Current Clients: Specific Rules</h2>
<p>(a) A lawyer shall not enter into a business transaction with a
client or knowingly acquire an ownership, possessory, security or other
pecuniary interest adverse to a client unless:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) the transaction and terms on which the lawyer acquires the
interest are fair and reasonable to the client and are fully disclosed
and transmitted in writing in a manner that can be reasonably understood
by the client;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) the client is advised in writing of the desirability of seeking
and is given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent
legal counsel on the transaction; and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(3) the client gives informed consent, in a writing signed by the
client, to the essential terms of the transaction and the lawyer’s role
in the transaction, including whether the lawyer is representing the
client in the transaction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(b) A lawyer shall not use information relating to representation of
a client to the disadvantage of the client unless the client gives
informed consent, except as permitted or required by these Rules.</p>
<p>(c) A lawyer shall not solicit any substantial gift from a client,
including a testamentary gift, or prepare on behalf of a client an
instrument giving the lawyer or a person related to the lawyer any
substantial gift unless the lawyer or other recipient of the gift is
related to the client. For purposes of this paragraph, related persons
include a spouse, child, grandchild, parent, grandparent or other
relative or individual with whom the lawyer or the client maintains a
close, familial relationship.</p>

shall not make or negotiate an agreement giving the lawyer literary or
media rights to a portrayal or account based in substantial part on
information relating to the representation.</p>
<p>(e) A lawyer shall not provide financial assistance to a client in
connection with pending or contemplated litigation, except that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) a lawyer may advance court costs and expenses of litigation, the
repayment of which may be contingent on the outcome of the matter;
and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) a lawyer representing an indigent client may pay court costs and
expenses of litigation on behalf of the client.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(f) A lawyer shall not accept compensation for representing a client
from one other than the client unless:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) the client gives informed consent;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) there is no interference with the lawyer’s independence of
professional judgment or with the client-lawyer relationship; and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(3) information relating to representation of a client is protected
as required by Rule 1.6.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(g) A lawyer who represents two or more clients shall not participate
in making an aggregate settlement of the claims of or against the
clients, or in a criminal case an aggregated agreement as to guilty or
nolo contendere pleas, unless each client gives informed consent, in a
writing signed by the client. The lawyer’s disclosure shall include the
existence and nature of all the claims or pleas involved and of the
participation of each person in the settlement.</p>
<p>(h) A lawyer shall not:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) make an agreement prospectively limiting the lawyer’s liability
to a client for malpractice unless the client is independently
represented in making the agreement; or</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) settle a claim or potential claim for such liability with an
unrepresented client or former client unless that person is advised in
writing of the desirability of seeking and is given a reasonable
opportunity to seek the advice of independent legal counsel in
connection therewith.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(i) A lawyer shall not acquire a proprietary interest in the cause of
action or subject matter of litigation the lawyer is conducting for a
client, except that the lawyer may:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) acquire a lien authorized by law to secure the lawyer’s fee or
expenses; and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) contract with a client for a reasonable contingent fee in a civil
case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(j) A lawyer shall not have sexual relations with a client unless a
consensual sexual relationship existed between them when the
client-lawyer relationship commenced.</p>
<p>(k) While lawyers are associated in a firm, a prohibition in the
foregoing paragraphs&gt; (a) through&gt; (i) that applies to any one of
them shall apply to all of them.</p>
</section>

<section id="rule-19-duties-to-former-clients"
class="title-slide slide level2">
<h2>Rule 1.9: Duties to Former Clients</h2>
<p>(a) A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter shall
not thereafter represent another person in the same or a substantially
related matter in which that person’s interests are materially adverse
to the interests of the former client unless the former client gives
informed consent, confirmed in writing.</p>
<p>(b) A lawyer shall not knowingly represent a person in the same or a
substantially related matter in which a firm with which the lawyer
formerly was associated had previously represented a client</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) whose interests are materially adverse to that person; and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) about whom the lawyer had acquired information protected by Rules
1.6 and 1.9(c) that is material to the matter; unless the former client
gives informed consent, confirmed in writing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(c) A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter or
whose present or former firm has formerly represented a client in a
matter shall not thereafter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) use information relating to the representation to the
disadvantage of the former client except as these Rules would permit or
require with respect to a client, or when the information has become
generally known; or</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) reveal information relating to the representation except as these
Rules would permit or require with respect to a client.</p>

<h2>Rule 1.10: Imputation of Conflicts of Interest: General Rule</h2>
<p>(a) While lawyers are associated in a firm, none of them shall
knowingly represent a client when any one of them practicing alone would
be prohibited from doing so by Rules 1.7 or 1.9, unless</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) the prohibition is based on a personal interest of the
disqualified lawyer and does not present a significant risk of
materially limiting the representation of the client by the remaining
lawyers in the firm; or</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) the prohibition is based upon Rule 1.9(a) or (b) and arises out
of the disqualified lawyer’s association with a prior firm, and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(i) the disqualified lawyer is timely screened from any participation
in the matter and is apportioned no part of the fee therefrom;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(ii) written notice is promptly given to any affected former client
to enable the former client to ascertain compliance with the provisions
of this Rule, which shall include a description of the screening
procedures employed; a statement of the firm’s and of the screened
lawyer’s compliance with these Rules; a statement that review may be
available before a tribunal; and an agreement by the firm to respond
promptly to any written inquiries or objections by the former client
about the screening procedures; and</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(iii) certifications of compliance with these Rules and with the
screening procedures are provided to the former client by the screened
lawyer and by a partner of the firm, at reasonable intervals upon the
former client’s written request and upon termination of the screening
procedures.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>(b) When a lawyer has terminated an association with a firm, the firm
is not prohibited from thereafter representing a person with interests
materially adverse to those of a client represented by the formerly
associated lawyer and not currently represented by the firm, unless:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) the matter is the same or substantially related to that in which
the formerly associated lawyer represented the client; and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) any lawyer remaining in the firm has information protected by
Rules 1.6 and 1.9(c) that is material to the matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(c) A disqualification prescribed by this rule may be waived by the
affected client under the conditions stated in Rule 1.7.</p>
<p>(d) The disqualification of lawyers associated in a firm with former
or current government lawyers is governed by Rule 1.11.</p>

class="title-slide slide level2">
<h2>Rule 1.11: Special Conflicts of Interest for Former &amp; Current
Government Officers &amp; Employees</h2>
<p>(a) Except as law may otherwise expressly permit, a lawyer who has
formerly served as a public officer or employee of the government:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) is subject to Rule 1.9(c); and</p>
<p>(2) shall not otherwise represent a client in connection with a
matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially as
a public officer or employee, unless the appropriate government agency
gives its informed consent, confirmed in writing, to the
representation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(b) When a lawyer is disqualified from representation under paragraph
(a), no lawyer in a firm with which that lawyer is associated may
knowingly undertake or continue representation in such a matter
unless:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) the disqualified lawyer is timely screened from any participation
in the matter and is apportioned no part of the fee therefrom; and</p>
<p>(2) written notice is promptly given to the appropriate government
agency to enable it to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this
rule.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(c) Except as law may otherwise expressly permit, a lawyer having
information that the lawyer knows is confidential government information
about a person acquired when the lawyer was a public officer or
employee, may not represent a private client whose interests are adverse
to that person in a matter in which the information could be used to the
material disadvantage of that person. As used in this Rule, the term
“confidential government information” means information that has been
obtained under governmental authority and which, at the time this Rule
is applied, the government is prohibited by law from disclosing to the
public or has a legal privilege not to disclose and which is not
otherwise available to the public. A firm with which that lawyer is
associated may undertake or continue representation in the matter only
if the disqualified lawyer is timely screened from any participation in
the matter and is apportioned no part of the fee therefrom.</p>
<p>(d) Except as law may otherwise expressly permit, a lawyer currently
serving as a public officer or employee:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) is subject to Rules 1.7 and 1.9; and</p>
<p>(2) shall not:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(i) participate in a matter in which the lawyer participated
personally and substantially while in private practice or
nongovernmental employment, unless the appropriate government agency
gives its informed consent, confirmed in writing; or</p>
<p>(ii) negotiate for private employment with any person who is involved
as a party or as lawyer for a party in a matter in which the lawyer is
participating personally and substantially, except that a lawyer serving
as a law clerk to a judge, other adjudicative officer or arbitrator may
negotiate for private employment as permitted by Rule 1.12(b) and
subject to the conditions stated in Rule 1.12(b).</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>(e) As used in this Rule, the term “matter” includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) any judicial or other proceeding, application, request for a
ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy,
investigation, charge, accusation, arrest or other particular matter
involving a specific party or parties, and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) any other matter covered by the conflict of interest rules of the
appropriate government agency.</p>

<h2>Rule 1.12: Former Judge, Arbitrator, Mediator or Other Third-Party
Neutral</h2>
<p>(a) Except as stated in paragraph (d), a lawyer shall not represent
anyone in connection with a matter in which the lawyer participated
personally and substantially as a judge or other adjudicative officer or
law clerk to such a person or as an arbitrator, mediator or other
third-party neutral, unless all parties to the proceeding give informed
consent, confirmed in writing.</p>
<p>(b) A lawyer shall not negotiate for employment with any person who
is involved as a party or as lawyer for a party in a matter in which the
lawyer is participating personally and substantially as a judge or other
adjudicative officer or as an arbitrator, mediator or other third-party
neutral. A lawyer serving as a law clerk to a judge or other
adjudicative officer may negotiate for employment with a party or lawyer
involved in a matter in which the clerk is participating personally and
substantially, but only after the lawyer has notified the judge or other
adjudicative officer.</p>
<p>(c) If a lawyer is disqualified by paragraph (a), no lawyer in a firm
with which that lawyer is associated may knowingly undertake or continue
representation in the matter unless:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) the disqualified lawyer is timely screened from any participation
in the matter and is apportioned no part of the fee therefrom; and</p>
<p>(2) written notice is promptly given to the parties and any
appropriate tribunal to enable them to ascertain compliance with the
provisions of this Rule.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(d) An arbitrator selected as a partisan of a party in a multimember
arbitration panel is not prohibited from subsequently representing that
party.</p>
</section>

<section id="rule-113-organization-as-client"
class="title-slide slide level2">
<h2>Rule 1.13: Organization as Client</h2>
<p>(a) A lawyer employed or retained by an organization represents the
organization acting through its duly authorized constituents.</p>
<p>(b) If a lawyer for an organization knows that an officer, employee
or other person associated with the organization is engaged in action,
intends to act or refuses to act in a matter related to the
representation that is a violation of a legal obligation to the
organization, or a violation of law that reasonably might be imputed to
the organization, and that is likely to result in substantial injury to
the organization, then the lawyer shall proceed as is reasonably
necessary in the best interest of the organization. Unless the lawyer
reasonably believes that it is not necessary in the best interest of the
organization to do so, the lawyer shall refer the matter to higher
authority in the organization, including, if warranted by the
circumstances to the highest authority that can act on behalf of the
organization as determined by applicable law.</p>
<p>(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d), if</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) despite the lawyer’s efforts in accordance with paragraph (b) the
highest authority that can act on behalf of the organization insists
upon or fails to address in a timely and appropriate manner an action,
or a refusal to act, that is clearly a violation of law, and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) the lawyer reasonably believes that the violation is reasonably
certain to result in substantial injury to the organization, then the
lawyer may reveal information relating to the representation whether or
not Rule 1.6 permits such disclosure, but only if and to the extent the
lawyer reasonably believes necessary to prevent substantial injury to
the organization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(d) Paragraph (c) shall not apply with respect to information
relating to a lawyer’s representation of an organization to investigate
an alleged violation of law, or to defend the organization or an
officer, employee or other constituent associated with the organization
against a claim arising out of an alleged violation of law.</p>
<p>(e) A lawyer who reasonably believes that he or she has been
discharged because of the lawyer’s actions taken pursuant to paragraphs
(b) or (c), or who withdraws under circumstances that require or permit
the lawyer to take action under either of those paragraphs, shall
proceed as the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to assure that the
organization’s highest authority is informed of the lawyer’s discharge
or withdrawal.</p>
<p>(f) In dealing with an organization’s directors, officers, employees,
members, shareholders or other constituents, a lawyer shall explain the
identity of the client when the lawyer knows or reasonably should know
that the organization’s interests are adverse to those of the
constituents with whom the lawyer is dealing.</p>
<p>(g) A lawyer representing an organization may also represent any of
its directors, officers, employees, members, shareholders or other
constituents, subject to the provisions of Rule 1.7. If the
organization’s consent to the dual representation is required by Rule
1.7, the consent shall be given by an appropriate official of the
organization other than the individual who is to be represented, or by
the shareholders.</p>

<section id="rule-114-client-with-diminished-capacity"
class="title-slide slide level2">
<h2>Rule 1.14: Client with Diminished Capacity</h2>
<p>(a) When a client’s capacity to make adequately considered decisions
in connection with a representation is diminished, whether because of
minority, mental impairment or for some other reason, the lawyer shall,
as far as reasonably possible, maintain a normal client-lawyer
relationship with the client.</p>
<p>(b) When the lawyer reasonably believes that the client has
diminished capacity, is at risk of substantial physical, financial or
other harm unless action is taken and cannot adequately act in the
client’s own interest, the lawyer may take reasonably necessary
protective action, including consulting with individuals or entities
that have the ability to take action to protect the client and, in
appropriate cases, seeking the appointment of a guardian ad litem,
conservator or guardian.</p>
<p>(c) Information relating to the representation of a client with
diminished capacity is protected by Rule 1.6. When taking protective
action pursuant to paragraph (b), the lawyer is impliedly authorized
under Rule 1.6(a) to reveal information about the client, but only to
the extent reasonably necessary to protect the client’s interests.</p>

<section id="rule-115-safekeeping-property"
class="title-slide slide level2">
<h2>Rule 1.15: Safekeeping Property</h2>
<p>(a) A lawyer shall hold property of clients or third persons that is
in a lawyer’s possession in connection with a representation separate
from the lawyer’s own property. Funds shall be kept in a separate
account maintained in the state where the lawyer’s office is situated,
or elsewhere with the consent of the client or third person. Other
property shall be identified as such and appropriately safeguarded.
Complete records of such account funds and other property shall be kept
by the lawyer and shall be preserved for a period of [five years] after
termination of the representation.</p>
<p>(b) A lawyer may deposit the lawyer’s own funds in a client trust
account for the sole purpose of paying bank service charges on that
account, but only in an amount necessary for that purpose.</p>
<p>(c) A lawyer shall deposit into a client trust account legal fees and
expenses that have been paid in advance, to be withdrawn by the lawyer
only as fees are earned or expenses incurred.</p>
