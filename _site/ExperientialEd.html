<hr />

<h3 id="liability-rules">Liability Rules</h3>

<p>Liability rules and related legal principles provide a framework for adopting policies and practices to reduce the likelihood of problems arising, mitigate the extent of harm if they do arise, and allocate the costs of remedying problems that do arise.</p>

      <li>Assumed by voluntary agreement (i.e. contract)</li>

      <li>Bad publicity</li>
    </ul>

      <li>The school assigned the student to the internship site</li>

<p>Requires payment of minimum wage, with overtime premium, for all covered employees</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="are-interns-employees">Are Interns “Employees”?</h3>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘Employer’ includes any person acting directly or indirectly in the
interest of an employer in relation to an employee ….</p>

<h3 id="internships-under-the-flsa-1">Internships under the FLSA</h3>

<p>The current Labor Department guidance, following recent court decisions, applies a “primary beneficiary” test for determining whether an intern is an employee under the FLSA.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="primary-beneficiary-test">Primary Beneficiary Test</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>[A]n employment relationship is not created when the tangible and intangible benefits provided to the intern are greater than the intern’s contribution to the employer’s operation.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="primary-beneficiary-test-1">Primary Beneficiary Test</h3>

<p>Based on consideration of seven factors</p>

<ul>
  <li>Determination is based on the “totality of circumstances”</li>
  <li>No single factor is decisive</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="primary-beneficiary-test-factors">Primary Beneficiary Test: Factors</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Extent to which the intern and employer clearly understand that there is no expectation of compensation. Any promise of compensation, express or implied, suggests that the intern is an employee—and vice versa.</li>
  <li>Extent to which the internship provides training similar to what would be given in an educational environment, including clinical and other hands-on training provided by educational institutions.</li>
  <li>Extent to which the internship is tied to the intern’s formal education program by integrated coursework or receipt of academic credit.</li>
  <li>Extent to which the internship accommodates the intern’s academic commitments by corresponding to the academic calendar.</li>
  <li>Extent to which the internship’s duration is limited to the period in which the internship provides the intern with beneficial learning.</li>
  <li>Extent to which the intern’s work complements, rather than displaces, the work of paid employees while providing significant educational benefits to the intern.</li>
  <li>Extent to which the intern and the employer understand that the internship is conducted without entitlement to a paid job at the conclusion of the internship.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="significance-for-experiential-education-programs">Significance for Experiential Education Programs</h3>

<p>Under the primary beneficiary standard</p>

<ul>
  <li>Receipt of academic credit and connection to formal educational program, will weigh strongly against employee status.
    <ul>
      <li>But neither academic credit nor connection to formal educational program is required.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Internships may be unpaid even if interns do the same work as regular employees.</li>
  <li>Value of intern’s work to the business should count in deciding who is the “primary beneficiary”.
    <ul>
      <li>Unclear how this is supposed to be weighed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="internships-with-government-and-non-profits">Internships with Government and Non-Profits</h3>
