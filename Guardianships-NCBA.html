<h2>Case 1: Representing a Client in an Incompetency Proceeding (98 FEO
16)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wife, who is elderly, was removed from the martial home.
<ul>
<li>Husband, also elderly, asked Attorney to investigate.</li>
<li>Attorney discovered that Wife was the subject of an involuntary
incompetency proceeding.</li>
<li>Wife told Attorney she wanted Attorney to represent her in resisting
the petition.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Attorney also learned that Husband was investigated about alleged
abuse and neglect of Wife.
<ul>
<li>Attorney told Husband he could not represent both Wife &amp;
husband.</li>
<li>Husband agreed that Attorney would only represent Wife in resisting
petition</li>
<li>Husband agreed he would pay legal fees and a written fee agreement
was executed.</li>
<li>Wife continued to express desire that Attorney represent her.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>At incompetency hearing, Attorney was not allowed to participate in
hearing as counsel for Wife.
<ul>
<li>Wife could not identify Attorney as her lawyer.</li>
<li>Clerk declared Wife incompetent and appointed director of DSS as her
legal guardian</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Attorney filed notice of appeal
<ul>
<li>DSS contends Attorney has no authority to represent Wife because she
has been adjudicated incompetent and only her legal guardian may make
decisions about her legal representation.</li>
<li>DSS lawyer demands that Attorney provide guardian with copies
documents in Wife’s legal file.</li>

</section>
<section class="slide level3">

<p><em>Does Attorney have a conflict of interest because he was
initially hired by Husband?</em></p>
<p>No. The representation of Wife in the incompetency proceeding is not
a representation that is adverse to the interest of Husband.</p>
<ul>
<li>Attorney obtained the consent of Husband to represent only Wife in
the incompetency proceeding.</li>
<li>The exercise of Attorney’s independent professional judgment on
behalf of Wife is not impaired by the prior representation of
Husband.</li>
<li><em>See</em> Rule 1.7 and Rule 1.9.</li>

</section>
<section class="slide level3">

<p><em>Does it matter that Husband pays for the representation of
Wife?</em></p>
<p>No. Rule 1.8(f) of the Revised Rules of Professional Conduct permits
a lawyer to accept compensation for representing a client from someone
other than the client if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the client consents after consultation;</li>
<li>there is no interference with the lawyer’s independent professional
judgment or the attorney-client relationship; and</li>
<li>the confidentiality of client information is protected.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Issue 3</h3>
<p><em>Does Attorney have to treat Wife as incompetent and defer to the
decision of the guardian relative to the representation of
Wife?</em></p>
</section>
<section class="slide level3">

<p><em>Does Attorney have to treat Wife as incompetent and defer to the
decision of the guardian relative to the representation of
Wife?</em></p>
<p>No. Wife is entitled to counsel of her own choosing particularly with
regard to a proceeding that so clearly and directly affects her freedom
to continue to make decisions for herself.</p>
<ul>
<li>If Attorney is able to maintain a relatively normal client-lawyer
relationship with Wife and Attorney reasonably believes that Wife is
able to make adequately considered decisions in connection with her
representation, Attorney may continue to represent her alone without
including the guardian in the representation.</li>
<li>However, if Attorney has reason to believe that Wife is incapable to
making decisions about her representation and is indeed incompetent, the
appeal of the finding of incompetency may be frivolous.
<ul>
<li>If so, Attorney may not represent her on the appeal.</li>
</ul></li>

<p><em>Once the guardian was appointed for Wife, did the guardian become
Attorney’s client, or otherwise step into the shoes of Wife, such that
Attorney may only take directions from the guardian and not from
Wife?</em></p>
<p>No. Rule 1.14(a) indicates that a lawyer may represent a client under
a mental disability.</p>
<ul>
<li>The lawyer owes the duty of loyalty to the client and not to the
guardian or legal representative of the client, particularly if the
lawyer concludes that the legal guardian is not acting in the best
interest of the client.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="issue-5" class="slide level3">
<h3>Issue 5</h3>
<p><em>Does Attorney have to turn over Wife’s legal file to Wife’s
appointed guardian?</em></p>
</section>
<section class="slide level3">

<p><em>Does Attorney have to turn over Wife’s legal file to Wife’s
appointed guardian?</em></p>
<p>No. When a guardian is appointed for a client, a lawyer may turn over
materials in the client’s file and disclose other confidential
information to the guardian if the release of such confidential
information is consistent with the purpose of the original
representation of the client or consistent with the express instructions
of the client.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, where, as here, the release of confidential information to
a guardian is contrary to the purpose of the representation, the lawyer
must protect the confidentiality of the client’s information and may not
release the legal file to the guardian absent a court order.
<ul>
<li><em>See</em> Rule 1.6(d)(3).</li>

<h2>Case 2: Lawyer Hired by GAL for Civil Suit on Behalf of Ward (2006
FEO 9)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lawyer was hired Mother to file a personal injury action on behalf
of Minor.
<ul>
<li>Mother is the appointed guardian ad litem for Minor.</li>
<li>Minor was injured while riding in his grandmother’s car, which
collided with a truck.</li>
<li>Lawyer brought an action against the driver of the truck but not
against Grandmother.</li>
<li>Subsequent investigation by Lawyer’s expert has led the expert to
conclude that Grandmother was negligent and the truck driver was not
negligent.
<ul>
<li>Grandmother has substantial assets.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Lawyer and Mother disagree about the conduct of the litigation.
<ul>
<li>Lawyer believes that the action against the truck driver is not
warranted by the facts and should be dismissed.</li>
<li>Lawyer also believes a lawsuit against Grandmother is necessary to
protect Minor’s interests.</li>
<li>Mother does not want a lawsuit filed against Grandmother.</li>

<section class="slide level3">

<p><em>Does Lawyer owe a duty of confidentiality to Mother?</em></p>
<p>Yes, in her representative capacity as GAL for Minor.</p>
<ul>
<li>Minor and Mother, in her capacity as GAL, are both clients.</li>
<li>Lawyer’s primary duty is to represent the interests of Minor.</li>
<li>To the extent Mother acts outside her capacity as GAL, information
learned by Lawyer may be disclosed, even over Mother’s objection, if
necessary to represent Minor.</li>

</section>
<section class="slide level3">

<p><em>If GAL insists that Lawyer continue to prosecute the lawsuit
against the truck driver, what should Lawyer do?</em></p>
<p>If, based upon his expert’s analysis, Lawyer believes that Minor does
not have a claim against the truck driver and the litigation of against
the truck driver is, therefore, frivolous, Lawyer must file a motion to
withdraw.</p>
<ul>
<li>As an alternative to withdrawal, if Lawyer believes GAL is failing
to fulfill her fiduciary duties, Lawyer may seek to have GAL removed and
replaced by an independent guardian ad litem who can evaluate the action
against the truck driver and the claim against Grandmother objectively
and make an unbiased decision about the conduct of the litigation.</li>
<li>Prior to filing a motion to withdraw, Lawyer must inform GAL and
Minor of the status of the case, explain the reason he is moving to
withdraw, and provide appropriate legal advice.</li>
<li>A motion to withdraw or to remove and replace GAL should avoid the
disclosure of confidential information unless the disclosure is allowed
by Rule 1.6.
<ul>
<li>For example, Lawyer may disclose information about GAL relative to
actions that violate her fiduciary duties to Minor.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="issue-3-1" class="slide level3">
<h3>Issue 3</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mother is also named in her individual capacity as a plaintiff in
the lawsuit against Grandmother in order to pursue her personal claim
for reimbursement of medical expenditures made on behalf of Minor.
<ul>
<li>Lawyer also represents Mother in this capacity.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Does the dual representation of Mother in her personal capacity
and as GAL alter the responses?</em></p>
</section>
<section class="slide level3">

<p><em>Does the dual representation of Mother in her personal capacity
and as GAL alter the responses?</em></p>
<p>Yes. Lawyer may not file a motion to remove Mother as GAL while she
is represented by Lawyer in her personal capacity because this action
would be directly adverse to Mother.</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if Lawyer withdraws from the representation of Mother in her
personal capacity only (and continues to represent Minor and Mother in
her capacity as GAL), Lawyer may not file a motion to remove and replace
Mother as GAL because Rule 1.9(a) prohibits a lawyer from representing a
person whose interests are materially adverse to those of former client
in the same or substantially related matter.</li>
<li>The only course of action available to Lawyer is to move to withdraw
from the representation of all of the plaintiffs if he believes that the
action against the truck driver is frivolous.</li>

class="title-slide slide level2">
<h2>Case 3: Testimony by Attorney Serving as Guardian (2022 FEO 1)</h2>
<ul>
<li>An attorney who is not associated with the GAL Program is appointed
to serve the dual role of GAL volunteer and GAL attorney advocate.
<ul>
<li>In performing the statutory duties of the GAL volunteer, the
attorney will, among other things, interview and communicate with the
child-client, the placement provider, and other collateral sources;
draft and submit to the court GAL court reports, and testify about
his/her investigation and recommendations to protect and promote the
juvenile’s best interests.</li>
<li>The GAL court reports contain first-hand observations of the
Attorney and statements made to the attorney by the child-client that
are intended to be communicated to the court and statements made by the
placement provider, teacher, and other collateral contacts.</li>
<li>The GAL court reports also include recommendations to the court
about all aspects of the child-client’s life and the case including the
placement and custody of the child-client and services that should be
provided to the child-client, the parents, or other parties.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In some instances, the court will not admit the GAL court report
into evidence without the attorney providing the appropriate foundation
through their sworn testimony or affirmation.</li>

</section>
<section class="slide level3">

<p><em>May the attorney file with the court and offer a GAL court report
into evidence that he/she drafted?</em></p>
<p>Yes, if the court appoints the attorney solely in the GAL role.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, if the court appoints the attorney in the dual role of GAL
and attorney advocate, the attorney may only proceed if the attorney
informs the court of the ethical concerns associated with the attorney’s
dual role and the court concludes that the attorney may proceed in the
dual role.</li>
<li>When an attorney is appointed to serve the dual role of GAL and
Attorneydvocate, the Rules of Professional Conduct apply.
<ul>
<li>For example, except under limited circumstances, attorneys are
prohibited from acting as an advocate at a trial if the attorney is
likely to be a necessary witness. Rule 3.7.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Therefore, the attorney must inform the court that the attorney
cannot serve as a GAL and the advocate if the court will call upon the
attorney to testify.
<ul>
<li>The attorney must ask the court to limit the attorney’s role to
either the GAL or the advocate.</li>
<li>The attorney must also ask the court to either appoint a non-lawyer
to serve as the GAL or appoint a second attorney to serve as the
attorney advocate.</li>

<h2>Case 4: Communication with Guardian Ad Litem for Opposing Party
(2002 FEO 8)</h2>
<ul>
<li>An action alleging medical malpractice was brought on behalf of a
child who was injured, and Child’s Mother and Father.
<ul>
<li>Plaintiff-Attorneys represent Child, Mother and Father.</li>
<li>The defendants are represented by Defense-Attorneys.</li>
<li>A private lawyer (Guardian Ad Litem) was appointed by the court to
serve at guardian ad litem for the minor.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>At mediation, Defense-Attorneys asked to meet privately with
Guardian Ad Litem to discuss Child’s case.
<ul>
<li>Plantiff-Attorneys denied the request, maintaining that Guardian Ad
Litem is their client and, pursuant to Rule 4.2(a) Defense-Attorneys may
not communicate with their represented client without their
consent.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Defense-Attorneys contend that, as a lawyer, Guardian Ad Litem
“represents” Child and, therefore, has a professional responsibility to
exercise independent professional judgment on behalf of Child, which
includes making an independent inquiry of Defense-Attorneys’ proposals
and positions.
<ul>
<li>Defense-Attorneys further contend that Plaintiff-Attorneys may not
interfere with Guardian Ad Litem’s decision on whether to communicate
privately with Defense-Attorneys.</li>

to be represented by legal counsel and permit legal counsel to make
decisions about the strategy for the litigation.</p>

<li>The fact that the guardian ad litem is a lawyer does not make him or
her co-counsel for the purpose of litigating the case.</li>
