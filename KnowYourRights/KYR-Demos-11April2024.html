<h3>Permit Requirements</h3>
<p>Ordinance: permit applicants have to pay not more than $1000 per day,
and the county administrator is empowered to “adjust the amount to meet
the expense” based on the “maintenance of public order in the matter
licensed.”</p>

<h3>Permit Requirements: Rule</h3>
<p><em>Forsyth County of Georgia v Nationalist Movement</em> (1992)</p>
<p>The ordinance violates the 1st Amendment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Permit requirements can be imposed so long as they do not “delegate
overly broad licensing discretion to a government official,” and are
“not based on the content of the message.”</li>
<li>Here, “the decision how much to charge—or even whether to charge at
all—is left to the whim of the administrator.”</li>
<li>There are “no articulated standards” or “objective factors” on which
the administrator is instructed to rely, or a requirement to “provide an
explanation for the decision,” and the decision is not subject to review
on appeal.</li>
<li>“The ordinance often requires that the fee be based on the content
of the speech.”</li>

<h3>Literature Distribution: Rule</h3>
<p><em>Schneider v. New Jersey</em> (1939): The ordinance violates the

to justify prohibiting defendants from passing out First
Amendment-protected literature.</p>

place. Examples in this context would be traffic control or public
safety.</p>
