<h3>Permit Requirements</h3>
<p>Ordinance: permit applicants have to pay not more than $1000 per day,
and the county administrator is empowered to “adjust the amount to meet
the expense” based on the “maintenance of public order in the matter
licensed.”</p>

<section id="permit-requirements-rule" class="slide level3">
<h3>Permit Requirements: Rule</h3>
<p><em>Forsyth County of Georgia v Nationalist Movement</em> (1992)</p>
<p>The ordinance violates the 1st Amendment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Permit requirements can be imposed so long as they do not “delegate
overly broad licensing discretion to a government official,” and are
“not based on the content of the message.”</li>
<li>Here, “the decision how much to charge—or even whether to charge at
all—is left to the whim of the administrator.”</li>
<li>There are “no articulated standards” or “objective factors” on which
the administrator is instructed to rely, or a requirement to “provide an
explanation for the decision,” and the decision is not subject to review
on appeal.</li>
<li>“The ordinance often requires that the fee be based on the content
of the speech.”</li>

<h3>Literature Distribution</h3>
<p>Ordinance bars the distribution of literature without a permit in
advance due to the government interest in preventing littering.</p>

<h3>Literature Distribution: Rule</h3>
<p><em>Schneider v. New Jersey</em> (1939): The ordinance violates the

to justify prohibiting defendants from passing out First
Amendment-protected literature.</p>

<section id="interfering-with-traffic-rule" class="slide level3">
<h3>Interfering with Traffic: Rule</h3>

are permissible when those protests cause interference with the
government’s purposes for the property on which the protest is taking
place. Examples in this context would be traffic control or public
safety.</p>
