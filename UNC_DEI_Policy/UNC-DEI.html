University of North Carolina” and associated regulations (§§ 300.8.5 and
300.8.5(R)) and replacing them with a new policy on “Equality Within the
University of North Carolina” (new § 300.8.5).</p>

of contemporary political debate or social action”</h4>
<p>UNC Policy Manual § 300.5.1(A)(5) (“Prohibition of Compelling
Speech”) provides that “the University shall neither ask nor requre an
employee or application for academic admission or employment to
affirmatively ascribe to or opine about beliefs, affiliations, ideals,
or principles regarding matters of contemporary political debate or
social action as a condition to admission, employment, or progessional
advancement. Nor shall any employee or applicant be solicited or
required to describe their actions in support of, or in opposition to,
such beliefs, affiliations, ideals, or principles.”</p>

debate or social action”.</p>

<p>(3) The constituent institution shall not require students, faculty,
or administrators to publicly express a given view of social policy</p>
<p>(3a) The constituent institution shall remain neutral, as an
institution, on the political controversies of the day.</p>

class="slide level3">
<h3>Training and Instruction in Public Schools and Universities</h3>
<p>Fla. Stat. § 1000.05(4)</p>
<div class="smallest-text">
<p>(a) It shall constitute discrimination on the basis of race, color,
national origin, or sex under this section to subject any student or
employee to training or instruction that espouses, promotes, advances,
inculcates, or compels such student or employee to believe any of the
following concepts:</p>
<div class="left-indent">
<p>1. Members of one race, color, national origin, or sex are morally
superior to members of another race, color, national origin, or sex.</p>
<p>2. A person, by virtue of his or her race, color, national origin, or
sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or
unconsciously.</p>
<p>3. A person’s moral character or status as either privileged or
oppressed is necessarily determined by his or her race, color, national
origin, or sex.</p>
<p>4. Members of one race, color, national origin, or sex cannot and
should not attempt to treat others without respect to race, color,
national origin, or sex.</p>
<p>5. A person, by virtue of his or her race, color, national origin, or
sex, bears responsibility for, or should be discriminated against or
receive adverse treatment because of, actions committed in the past by
other members of the same race, color, national origin, or sex.</p>
<p>6. A person, by virtue of his or her race, color, national origin, or
sex, should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment to
achieve diversity, equity, or inclusion.</p>
<p>7. A person, by virtue of his or her race, color, sex, or national
origin, bears personal responsibility for and must feel guilt, anguish,
or other forms of psychological distress because of actions, in which
the person played no part, committed in the past by other members of the
same race, color, national origin, or sex.</p>
<p>8. Such virtues as merit, excellence, hard work, fairness,
neutrality, objectivity, and racial colorblindness are racist or sexist,
or were created by members of a particular race, color, national origin,
or sex to oppress members of another race, color, national origin, or
sex.</p>
</div>
<p>(b) Paragraph (a) may not be construed to prohibit discussion of the
concepts listed therein as part of a larger course of training or
instruction, provided such training or instruction is given in an
objective manner without endorsement of the concepts.</p>

<h4 id="_pernell-v-florida-board-of-governors_"><em>Pernell v. Florida
Board of Governors</em></h4>
<p>In <em>Pernell</em> a group of public university faculty and students
assert that Fla. Stat. § 1000.05(4) unconstitutionally “prohibit[s]
expression of certain viewpoints regarding the eight specified concepts
during class instruction.” In November 2022, the trial court granted the
plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of
§ 1000.05(4) and associated regulations adopted by the Florida Board of
Governors of the State University System. 641 F. Supp. 3d 1218 (N.D.
Fla. 2022).</p>
<p>An appeal is currently pending in the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals.</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level3">

<h4 id="_honeyfundcom-inc-v-desantis_"><em>Honeyfund.com Inc. v.
DeSantis</em></h4>
<p>In <em>Honeyfund</em>, the plaintiffs challenged another section of
the Florida “Individual Freedom Act” that imposes similar restrictions
on employee training by any employer, public or private. Earlier this
year, the Court of Appeals upheld a preliminary injuction on
constitutional grounds. 94 F.4th 1272 (11th Cir. March 4, 2024).</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level3">

<h4 id="_black-emergency-response-team-v-drummond_"><em>Black Emergency
Response Team v. Drummond</em></h4>
<p>An Oklahoma law prohibits the teaching of certain concepts, similar
to those targetted in NC and Florida, in public K-12 schools. In
<em>Drummond</em>, the court recently dismissed a 1st Amendment
challenge, holding that the Oklahoma law “is directed to the curricular
speech of K-12 teachers in Oklahoma and that, in accordance with the
authority set forth above, such curricular speech is not protected by
the First Amendment.” 2024 WL 3014659 (W.D. Okla. June 14, 2024)</p>
<p>The court allowed the plaintiffs to proceed with other claims:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 1st Amendment challenge to a provision that prohibits “any form of
mandatory gender or sexual diversity training or counseling” for
students in the state’s public university system, noting “that the
curricular speech of the university level instructor-Plaintiffs is
protected to some extent by the First Amendment.”</li>
<li>A 14th Amendment challenge to restrictions on K-12 instruction and
diversity training in public universities on grounds that they were
enacted “with the purpose to discriminate against students of color by
chilling and suppressing Inclusive Speech aimed at enhancing the
educational, social, and civic experiences of students of color and
their families” and that some of the statutory terms are
uncontitutionally vague.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="personal-titles-and-pronouns" class="slide level3">
<h3>Personal titles and pronouns</h3>
<p>Another provision of the Florida “Individual Freedom Act” restricts
the use of personal titles and pronouns in public K-12 schools:</p>
<p>Fla. Stat. § 1000.071</p>
<div class="smallest-text">
<p>(1) It shall be the policy of every public K-12 educational
institution that is provided or authorized by the Constitution and laws
of Florida that a person’s sex is an immutable biological trait and that
it is false to ascribe to a person a pronoun that does not correspond to
such person’s sex.</p>
<p>(3) An employee or contractor of a public K-12 educational
institution may not provide to a student his or her preferred personal
title or pronouns if such preferred personal title or pronouns do not
correspond to his or her sex.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="slide level3">

<h4 id="_wood-v-florida-dept-of-educ_"><em>Wood v. Florida Dept. of
Educ.</em></h4>
<p>In <em>Wood</em>, a public school teacher who is a transgender woman
challenged § 1000.071(3). Granting the plaintiff’s request for a
preliminary injunction, the court agreed that the statute
unconstitutionally restricts the plaintiff’s freedom of speech as a
citizen regarding a matter of public concern:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This Court is reminded of Walt Whitman’s “Song of Myself,” a
gleefully sweeping masterpiece of American poetry that opens with these
lines:</p>
<p>“I celebrate myself, and sing myself, And what I assume you shall
assume, For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.”</p>
<p>In sharing her preferred title and pronouns, Ms. Wood celebrates
herself and sings herself—not in a disruptive or coercive way, but in a
way that subtly vindicates her identity, her dignity, and her humanity.
Section 1000.071(3) has silenced her and, by silencing her, forced her
to inhabit an identity that is not her own. The State of Florida has not
justified this grave restraint, and so the United States Constitution
does not tolerate it. Ours is a Union of individuals, celebrating
ourselves and singing ourselves and being ourselves without apology.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="small-text">
<p>2024 WL 1536749 (N.D. Fla. April 9, 2024).</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="slide level3">

<h4 id="_wood-v-florida-dept-of-educ_-1"><em>Wood v. Florida Dept. of
Educ.</em></h4>
<p>The plaintiffs in <em>Wood</em> also assert claims under Title VII
and Title IX, contending that prohibiting them from providing their
preferred personal titles and pronouns unlawfully discriminates on the
basis of sex. The court recently denied the defendants’ motion to
dismiss those claims. 2024 WL 3371319 (N.D. Fla. July 10, 2024).</p>
