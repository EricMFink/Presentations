The information in this presentation is not intended to constitute legal advice and should not be relied upon in lieu of consultation with appropriate legal counsel in your own jurisdiction.

# Overview

*** 

## Basic Principles

- Liability & risk management 
- Torts: Duty & liability
- Contracts as risk management tools 

*** 

## Special Topics

- Discrimination
- Study Abroad
- Employment
- Confidentiality


# Liability & Risk Management 

*** 

## Liability 

- Legal responsibility for harm to another



*** 

### Liability Rules

Liability rules and related legal principles provide a framework for adopting policies and practices to reduce the likelihood of problems arising, mitigate the extent of harm if they do arise, and allocate the costs of remedying problems that do arise.

*** 

### Basis of Liability

- Liability is based on a legal duty to the injured party
	- Imposed by law (e.g. tort, property, statute, etc.)
	- Assumed by voluntary agreement (i.e. contract)
- Harm (injury or loss) alone does not equal liability 

*** 

### Assessing Liability and Remedies

- What happened?
- Who is at fault?
- How to remedy the harm?
- Is there an agreement that alters the default legal rules or shifts responsibility?

*** 

### Vicarious Liability

- Responsibility of one person (“Principal”) based on acts of another person (“Agent”) acting under their direction or control.
	- E.g. Employers and employees
- The Principal is also liable for their own negligence in hiring, supervising, and retaining the Agent. 

*** 

## Risk Management 

- Good risk management helps protect against adverse consequences: 
	- Legal liability 
	- Impaired relationships
	- Bad publicity 

***

### Liability Risks in Experiential Education 

Distinctive features of experiential learning programs may bring exposure to legal issues and risks beyond those that generally arise in the educational setting:

- Location
	- Outside the classroom
	- Away from campus
- Activity
	- Learning by doing

*** 

### Liability Risks in Experiential Education 

These distinctive features have implications for managing the risk of potential liability: 

- Control and supervision
- Shared responsibilities


# Torts

*** 

## Duties Imposed by Law

- Based on
	- Parties' legal status or relationship
	- Nature and context of their activity
- Does not depend on voluntary agreement

*** 

## Negligence

- Failure to exercise the requisite degree of care

*** 

### Elements of Negligence

- Duty of care
- Breach of the duty
- Injury caused by the breach

*** 

### Duty of Care

What a “reasonable person” would do under the circumstances

- Fact-specific assessment
	- Parties’ knowledge and experience
	- Parties’ relationship
	- Nature of the situation

*** 

### Breach of Duty 

- Careless action
- Failure to act

*** 

### Injury Caused by Breach

- Personal injury (physical, emotional, reputational)
- Property damage


# Contracts

*** 

## Duties based on voluntary private agreement

Parties use contracts to assign and define their respective duties as they see fit.

- Subject to some limits or requirements of “public” law (i.e. tort law, statutes, regulations, etc.).

*** 

### Contracts take many forms

- Written or Oral
	- Oral contracts are generally valid
	- But proving the terms can be difficult
- Express or Implied
	- Parties may enter into a contract based on their conduct

*** 

## Breach of Contract

- A party fails to perform in accordance with the contract terms.
- The other party suffers a loss or incurs a cost as a result of the breach.

*** 

## Contracts as Risk Management Tools

***

### Contracts with students, internship sites, etc.

- Specify the responsibilities of each party
- Specify the consequences if a party doesn’t fulfil its responsibilities

*** 

### Insurance and indemnification agreements

- Someone else agrees to cover the loss if you are found liable

*** 

### Waivers or limitations of liability

- Validity varies by state law


# Problem 1: The Dangerous Internship 

*** 

## Problem 1: The Dangerous Internship

You are the internship coordinator for a graduate program at your school. 

- All students in the program must complete an internship in the field.
- You assign students to internships from a list of approved sites. 
- There have been reported assaults and other crimes at or near one of the approved internship sites, and you are aware of these incidents.

*** 

## Problem 1: The Dangerous Internship

What risks would you foresee in assigning students to internships at that site?

What measures would you take to manage those risks?

*** 

### Nova Southeastern University v. Gross (Florida 2000)

- Student was assaulted on her way from an internship site to her car in a nearby lot
- Student was assigned to the intership by the school, which was aware of prior assaults and other criminal activity at the site
- School did not inform or warn student about the previous incidents

*** 

### Nova Southeastern University v. Gross

_Holding:_ School owed student a duty of care in making internship assignments

- “[T]he extent of the duty … is based on the amount of control the school has over the student’s conduct.”
- Control factors
	- The internship was required
	- The school assigned the student to the internship site
	- The school knew there had previously been assaults at that location

*** 

### Nova Southeastern University v. Gross

- By placing the student in a situation where the university knew there had been previous criminal incidents, the university had a duty to warn the student about that risk
- The failure to warn was negligent

*** 

### Nova Southeastern University v. Gross

- Would a warning have been enough to avoid liability?
	- “[T]he duty … could include but is not necessarily limited to warnings of the known dangers at this particular … site.”
- Would a warning still be required under different facts?
	- If the internship was optional?
	- If the student chose the location?
	- If there were no prior incidents?

*** 

### Implications for Risk Management in Program Administration

- Primary focus remains the educational program
	- Tailor the degree of control to promote learning goals and student experience
- Keep informed about problems and take appropriate action
	- Adjusting the program
	- Informing students
	- Other measures? 

*** 

### Use of agreements with host/partner organizations to avoid or mitigate risks

- Assign responsibility for measures to avoid harm
	- E.g. safe transportation, escorts between parking and site
- Indemnification agreements
	- E.g. Host organization agrees to bear the cost if university is sued (or vice versa)

*** 

# Discrimination 

*** 

## Federal Laws

- Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VI
	- Race, color, national origin 
- Education Amendments of 1972, Title IX
	- Sex 
- Age Discrimination Act of 1975
	- Age 
- Americans with Disabilities Act & Rehabilitation Act
	- Disability 

*** 

## State & Local Laws

- May mirror federal law
- May give more protection than federal law
	- Broader coverage
	- Greater remedies

*** 

## Coverage of Anti-Discrimination Laws 

- Based on membership in a “protected class”
	- e.g. race, sex, age, disability, etc.
- Sometimes tied to federal funding
	- Civil Rights Act, Title VI
	- Education Amendments Act, Title IX
	- Age Discrimination Act
	- Rehabilitation Act

*** 

## Prohibited Discrimination 

- Eligibility criteria and selection of students
- Terms of participation
- Placements and assignments
- Other aspects of the program


*** 

## Forms of Discrimination

- Unequal Terms and Conditions
	- Disparate treatment
	- Disparate impact
- Harassment
	- Quid pro quo
	- Hostile environment

*** 

## Title IX

> No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.

*** 

### "On the basis of sex"

- The Department of Education has issued guidance interpreting Title IX to cover discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity
- Some federal courts have adopted that interpretation in recent cases
	- Supreme Court has adopted this view under Title VII (employment discrimination)

*** 

### Sexual Harassment 

> [Conduct] that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, and that so undermines and detracts from the victims’ educational experience, that the victims are effective denied equal access to an institution’s resources and opportunities.

Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education (U.S. 1999)

*** 

## Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”)

- Prohibits discrimination in educational programs on account of a student’s disability
- Requires reasonable accommodation to enable qualified students with disabilities to participate in educational programs

*** 

## ADA Definitions 

- Disability
	- Physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a person in one or more life activities
- Person with a disability
	- Currently has a disability
	- History or record of a disability
	- Perceived by others (accurately or not) as having a disability
- Qualified person with a disability
	- Able to perform the essential activities of the educational program, either _with or without_ reasonable accommodation

*** 

### Accommodations under the ADA 

- Modifications or adjustments to the activity, environment, or procedures that enable qualified person with a disability to participate in the program

*** 

### Reasonable Accommodation 

- Effectively meets the student’s needs
	- Not necessarily the particular accommodation requested
- Does not fundamentally alter the educational program
- Does not impose an undue burden
	- Significant difficulty, disruption, or expense

*** 

### Examples of Accommodations 

- Auxiliary aids and services
	- Special equipment, assistive devices, or technology
	- Readers, interpreters, etc.
- Modified policies, practices, or procedures
	- Adjusted schedules
	- Additional time to complete tasks

*** 

### Accommodation Requests 

- Students are not required to disclose disabilities unless they request accommodation
- If a student requests accommodation, the school may require documentation
	- To confirm the validity of the request
	- To identify the nature of accommodation required

*** 

# Problem 2: Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil 

*** 

## Problem 2: Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil 

Your school runs a study-abroad program

- Participation in the program is limited to students enrolled at the school
- A faculty member from the school accompanies students on the program
- Female students participating in the program experience repeated sexual harassment by male students
- The students complain to the faculty supervisor, who tells them to resolve the problem themselves
- The students contact the study-abroad coordinator at the school, who tells them to speak to the professor
- The students decide to leave the program early and return home

*** 

## Problem 2: Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil 

- Is the university liable for the harassment when the perpetrators were also students?
- Does the fact that the harassment occurred in a studyabroad program make a difference to the school's liability under Title IX?

*** 

### Student-on-student harassment

- School may be liable if it “acts with deliberate indifference to known acts of harassment in its programs or activities.” Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Ed. (U.S. 1999)

*** 

### King v. Eastern Michigan University (E.D. Mich. 2002)

- University moved to dismiss the suit on grounds that Title IX did not apply to programs outside U.S.
- The court rejected that argument and allowed the suit to proceed
- Title IX applies to all programs of a U.S. college/university, regardless of where the program takes place, including study-abroad programs
- Plaintiffs were “persons in the United States” for purposes of Title IX, because they were participating in the study-abroad program as part of their education at EMU, and where the program was entirely under EMU’s control

*** 

### King v. Eastern Michigan University (E.D. Mich. 2002)

- What should the professor and other university personnel have done in response to the students' complaints?
- What might the university do to prevent or reduce the likelihood of such problems?

*** 

# Employment Law 

*** 

## Unpaid Internships 

*** 

### Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)

Requires payment of minimum wage, with overtime premium, for all covered employees 

*** 

### Are Interns "Employees"?

The statutory definition is unhelpful: 

> [T]he term ‘employee’ means any individual employed by an employer.

> 'Employer' includes any person acting directly or indirectly in the
interest of an employer in relation to an employee ….

> 'Employ' includes to suffer or permit to work.

*** 

### Internships under the FLSA

- The U.S. Department of Labor and the courts have developed tests to determine when a “trainee” or “intern” is an employee under the FLSA
	- No clear-cut rules
	- Fact-specific, case-by-case, assessment

*** 

### Internships under the FLSA

The current Labor Department guidance, following recent court decisions, applies a "primary beneficiary" test for determining whether an intern is an employee under the FLSA.

*** 

### Primary Beneficiary Test 

> [A]n employment relationship is not created when the tangible and intangible benefits provided to the intern are greater than the intern's contribution to the employer's operation. 

Glatt v. Fox Searchlight Pictures (2d Cir. 2015)


*** 

### Primary Beneficiary Test 

Based on consideration of seven factors

- Determination is based on the "totality of circumstances"
- No single factor is decisive


*** 

### Primary Beneficiary Test: Factors

- Extent to which the intern and employer clearly understand that there is no expectation of compensation. Any promise of compensation, express or implied, suggests that the intern is an employee—and vice versa.
- Extent to which the internship provides training similar to what would be given in an educational environment, including clinical and other hands-on training provided by educational institutions.
- Extent to which the internship is tied to the intern’s formal education program by integrated coursework or receipt of academic credit.
- Extent to which the internship accommodates the intern’s academic commitments by corresponding to the academic calendar.
- Extent to which the internship’s duration is limited to the period in which the internship provides the intern with beneficial learning.
- Extent to which the intern’s work complements, rather than displaces, the work of paid employees while providing significant educational benefits to the intern.
- Extent to which the intern and the employer understand that the internship is conducted without entitlement to a paid job at the conclusion of the internship.

*** 

### Significance for Experiential Education Programs

Under the primary beneficiary standard

- Receipt of academic credit and connection to formal educational program, will weigh strongly against employee status.
	- But neither academic credit nor connection to formal educational program is required.
- Internships may be unpaid even if interns do the same work as regular employees.
- Value of intern’s work to the business should count in deciding who is the "primary beneficiary".
	- Unclear how this is supposed to be weighed. 

*** 

### Internships with Government and Non-Profits

- The FLSA expressly permits unpaid volunteers at public agencies
- The Department of Labor has consistently interpreted the FLSA to permit unpaid volunteers with private non-profit organizations.
	- Applies to those engaged in the organization’s charitable work, not commercial activity. See Tony & Susan Alamo Foundation v. Secretary of Labor (US 1985)

*** 

# Confidentiality 

*** 

## Trade Secrets 

Primarily governed by state law 

- NC Trade Secrets Protection Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. § 66-152 et seq. 


Federal law provides additional remedies for infringement

- Defend Trade Secrets Act (“DTSA”), 18 U.S. Code § 1836

*** 

### Trade Secret Definition 

> "Trade secret" means business or technical information, including but not limited to a formula, pattern, program, device, compilation of information, method, technique, or process that:
> 
> a\. Derives independent actual or potential commercial value from not being generally known or readily ascertainable through independent development or reverse engineering by persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and
> 
> b\. Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.

N.C. Gen. Stat. § 66-152

*** 

### Trade Secret Protections  

Trade secret law protects against misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure.

Remedies may include monetary damages and injunctions prohibiting use or further disclosure. 

*** 

## Nondisclosure Agreements

- Contracts under which one party agrees not to disclose confidential information belonging to the other party
	- May modify or clarity pre-existing legal duties
	- May impose duty where one does not otherwise apply
- Often combined with noncompete agreements
	- Validity varies by state law
	- Unclear whether a noncompete agreement with a non-employee student intern would be enforceable in court
	- Might depend on whether the student receives some consideration (e.g. payment) beyond the intrinsic benefits of the internship

*** 

## Significance in Experiential Education

- Students may have access to trade secrets or other confidential information in the course of their work
- Students should understand that they may be subject to liability if they disclose or use trade secrets or other confidential information without permission
- If students are asked to sign nondisclosure agreements in connection with an internship or other program, it is advisable for them to have legal counsel
- University counsel might review agreements connected to educational programs
- University might arrange for lawyers to review such agreements for students on a pro bono or low-fee basis
